\section{Introduction}

In this chapter a overall mathematical introduction to the field of computational fluid dynamics is given. There are several
posibilities to classify and structure the wide field of CFD. In most literature this is done by focusing on the physical properties
of the fluid models itself e.g. \citep{Reference10} resulting in categories like incompressible or compressible fluid dynamics. Since the focus of this
report is not on the physical description of fluids, we will take a different approach and structure the report by the domain discretizations
schemes itself which result in the later Chapters 3 "Mesh-based Methods" and Chapter 4 "Mesh-free Methods". First of all a
brief destinction is made between mesh-based and mesh-free methods. These destinction is followed through the entire chapter
and will conclude in detailed descriptions of both methods given in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. Afterwards the governing physical Navier-Stokes
equations of CFD are given and explained in detail.
For further reading please refer to \citep{Date2005}, \citep{Cebeci2005}, \citep{Toro2009} and for a comprehensive overview of the mathematical notations in CFD please refer to \citep{Aris1989}.

\section {Numerical simulation proceedings}
Before diving into the physical world of CFD we first take a look at the general approach to solving a physical problem with a numerical simulation. By understanding this process we can lay out the Chapter in a more structured way. Figure \ref{fig:CFDSimProcess} shows this general process for a fluid flow problem and begins with the physical problem in the real world. Before even considering any kind of
computer program or mathematical equation, the physical phenomena that are involved or might appear in the real world have to be understood. Some important examples for this like \emph{turbulent flow} were given in Chapter \ref{Chapter2}. From this point on, one needs to abstract from nature in order to define a computable model. Conscious decisions have to be made whether the apprehended phenomena are relevant enought to
be involved in the mathematical modelling or not. At the beginning of the mathematical modelling process this Chapter will describe in Section \ref{sec:mathperspective} two major and different \textbf{perspectives} in how a observer can perceive a fluid flow. This \textbf{Eulerian} or \textbf{Lagrangian} perspective leads to different mathematical equations which will be discussed later. They have vast implications on the discretization process and simulation speed as it will be shown later.  After that the best approximation to the abstracted flow problem, the physical laws that influence the narrowed down
phenomena need to be indentified and mathematically modeled in the appropriate perspective. Usually this leads to mathematical equations, which are in differential or integral form and describe a continuous behaviour of a physical property. In Section \ref{sec:diff_eq} they are discussed. The most relevant physical laws and equations of fluid flow are given in Section \ref{sec:gov_eq_fluiddy}. In order to be computed by a machine with a finite and discrete number space in
finite time, the \emph{space}, \emph{equations} and even \emph{time} (for unsteady flow) need to be discretized. The discretization process will be explained in Section \ref{sec:Discretization} and in the following Chapters in great detail, since this is the focus of this report. Afterwards the discretized model needs to undergo a in-depth numerical analysis on the amount and type of errors the discretization has caused in comparision to the continuous model. This will be done in more detail in the specific discretization methods in the following Chapters (e.g. \ref{sec:taylor_ser_num_ana}). 
The last following four parts are not the focus of this report and would go beyond the constraints of it. Therefore introduction literature into these topics is given.  
The actual \textbf{Implementation} would take place, leading to a program that would take care of numerical \textbf{Solving} the equations and returning the relevant physical quantities dependent on space and time - the \textbf{Simulation}. These results need to be visualized and in many steps analyzed \citep{Oberkampf2010}.

Furthermore a comprehensive list of commercial CFD simulation programs is given in \citep[pg.139]{Martin2011}. To better understand the efficient solving of large sparse matrices please refer to \citep{Saad2003}.

\section{Eulerian and Lagrangian perspective} 
\label{sec:mathperspective}

While formulating the governing equations of a physical problem like fluid dynamics, there are two fundamentally different perspectives that can be taken by a observer to describe
the behaviour of that physical world. This perspective is also called \emph{observational frame of reference}. The Eulerian perspective depends on a static frame of reference. The Lagrangian perspective depends on a floating frame of reference. From these two perspectives different descriptions of the same problem will result . These have wide implications on the later solving of the formulated equations. They are essential to understand the differences within the Meshbased methods and moreover between them and the Meshfree methods.    In this report the term \emph{frame of reference} is not equivalent with the \emph{coordinate system} of a description. Also to shorten up the Eulerian description is often called simply \emph{Eulerian} and accordingly the Lagrangian description is called \emph{Lagrangian}.

To better understand both perspectives, please consider Figure \ref{fig:Olive_bottle_plain}. It illustrates
a glass bottle of olive oil (grey), which is mixed with spice particles like pepper (black) \footnote{Illustration inspired by Luis Cafarelli's lecture on the NSE. Video link to lecture active on 11th of March: http://vimeo.com/18185364}. The oil is incompressible and the particles are capable of moving freely around in the glass bottle. The observer is able to look inside the transparent glass bottle and identify single particles. These particles can also be seen as abstraction's of fluid parcel therefore both terms are used in exchange in this Section. The entire bottle is shaken, to give the particles and the entire fluid some initial movement. From time $t_{0}$ on the bottle's content is observed, while resting on a table.

\begin{figure}[htb]

\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Figures/olive_oil_can_01.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Figures/olive_oil_can_lagran.pdf}
\caption{Illustration of a glass bottle with Olive oil and spice particles}
\label{fig:Olive_bottle_plain}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Lagrangian Description}
\label{sec:lagrangian_descr}
In the Lagrangian perspective the observer focuses on each separate particle or fluid parcel as it moves inside the glass bottle over time. Therefore each particle is \emph{labelled} $p_{i}$ with $i \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$ at the time $t_{0}$ (resting bottle). The observer moves with each parcel and measures the physical values like velocity (arrow) or mass of it. These values are recorded for each particle $p_{i}$. One can consider these particles to be small moving \emph{sensors} that record physical properties of themselves. 

When the recorded information is presented of a property like speed, this might schematically look like the LHS of Figure \ref{fig:lagr_traj}. Each individual particle has the information of speed at a given time. For the observer this already implies that it is possible to know the fate of each particle and its values for the entire observed time. Furthermore one is able to plot the transport pathways, called \emph{pathlines}, of each individual particle in a transport process as depicted on the LHS of Figure \ref{fig:lagr_traj}.

\caption{Schematic diagram of particle's speed and pathlines in Lagrangian perspective}
\label{fig:lagr_traj}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Eulerian Description}
\label{sec:eulerian_descr}

In the Eulerian description the observer does not follow individual fluid parcels. He rather rests and focuses on certain selected locations in the domain of the glass bottle. To better identify these observation locations, a rectangular mesh is drawn onto the bottle with the intersections being the points of interest. In Figure \ref{fig:eulerian_bottle_observer} this is illustrated with hexagonal observer nodes that are located on the intersection points of a rectangular mesh. This mesh discretizes
the spatial domain of the glass bottle (see \nameref{subsec:eulerian_mesh}). A fluid parcel is only noticed over time and measured by the observer when it passes through a observer node, this is depicted with the red hexagons. So in contrast to the Lagrangian perspective, the \emph{sensors} are static in location. Consequently in the Eulerian the observer is not capable of knowing the trajectories of all fluid parcels.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Figures/olive_oil_can_eulerian.pdf}
\caption{Illustration of hexagonal observer nodes inside a rectangular mesh in Eulerian perspective}
\label{fig:eulerian_bottle_observer}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Lagrangian vs. Eulerian Description}
To bring both descriptions into a mathematical framework we first start with the Lagrangian. As mentioned above each individual particle is labeled $p_{i}$ at time $t_{0}$ when the bottle is released to rest. This label is a vector of the fluid properties or the particles Cartesian coordinates at the time of release. The Lagrangian observer follows the particle after time $t_{0}$ and notes down the position of this individual particle at time t as:

\begin{equation}
X_{i}(p_{j}, t_{0} | t)
\end{equation}

In Eulerian description the position of a observer is simply $x_{i}$. The above situation that this Eulerian observer is able to recognize a fluid parcel (red hexagons) is only given when:

\begin{equation}
x_{i} = X_{i}(p_{j}, t_{0} | t)
\end{equation}

Similar to this the velocity relation in Eulerian and Lagrangian perspective is given by:

\begin{equation}
v(x_{i},t) = \frac{\partial X_{i}}{\partial t} (p_{j}, t_{0} | t)
\end{equation}

Where the LHS denotes the velocity v from the fluid parcel detected by a Eulerian observer, the RHS denotes the Lagrangian version. In similar manner the relation to the rate of change of other physical quantities like heat or momentum can be found. A important mathematical instrument for this is the Stokes derivative, also called material derivative.

\subsection{Implications on Fluid Dynamics}

In Fluid Dynamics the transport or \emph{flux} of fluids is of primary interest. In Eulerian description the flux can only be estimated correctly when there is a dense spatial and temporal coverage of observing nodes.

Flux processes itself are fundamentally a Lagrangian quantity and therefore easier to describe in this perspective. As we will see in the following Chapters, methods with a Eulerian description like FVM have ways to estimate the flux in a certain region. But with more complicated, even deforming, geometry the Lagrangian description is capable of handling these changes far better (e.g FEM). The Lagrangian is used widely in astrophysics, where the gravity of stars, planets and galaxies interact within a vast space of vacuum without any interesting behaviour. The focus lies here on relatively few objects/parcels in comparison to the immense
spatial distribution of those. Concerning CFD a rough estimation can be already made that the Lagrangian is better for (many) single fluid parcels that are of interest and can have great deformation behaviour. As we will see in this report this is not entirely true. A method in Lagrangian description and a attached mesh can lead to more problems with deformations in CFD than a Eulerian method (see \nameref{sec:main_fem}). In addition
leaving out a mesh in a Lagrangian method, as it is done in \nameref{Chapter 5}, brings out the deformation robustness concerning CFD. For further reading please refer to \citep{Bennett2006}.

\section{Differential equations}
\label{sec:diff_eq}
In the following Section the \nameref{sec:gov_eq_fluiddy} are presented. These equations rely heavily on
higher mathematics and describe the fluids properties and flow with various differential equations. This section should brush up very briefly the knowledge on differential equations for the novice reader. Of utmost significance is the classification of partial differential equations into parabolic, hyperbolic and elliptic types, since the later numerical discretization methods are not equally capable of solving all of them efficiently.
\subsection{Ordinary Differential equations}
Ordinary Differential equations (ODE) occur in many CFD terms. Of special interest for this report are they because they are present in the \nameref{Chapter 5} method.

\section{Governing equations of Fluid Dynamics}
\label{sec:gov_eq_fluiddy}

As we have seen in Chapter \ref{Chapter2} there are many different types of flow in Fluid Dynamics and many physical properties that define them. As this report focuses on unsteady flow, a key finding of Science is that the \emph{entire} motion and behaviour of a fluid flow can be indicated by the conservation laws for \textbf{momentum}, \textbf{mass} and \textbf{energy}. We will use the already explained general form of conservation laws and apply them to these three properties leading to the Euler equations and Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are of a very general Nature and need supporting physical laws when they are applied to a more specific fluid type like \nameref{sec:incompress_fluid}. This can lead to a massive simplification of the NSE, since depending on the nature of the specified fluid type many equations become simpler or even zero out. Moreover also external properties like forces need be considered, when they actually influence the fluid itself. An excellent example of such can be found in \citep{Warner2010} where in order to model the behaviour of fluid packets in our atmosphere also the coriolis forces and Earth's gravity influence the fluids momentum. The set of equations are usually coupled to a certain degree, which complicates solving them. 

 

\subsection{Conservation of Momentum}



\subsection{Conservation of Mass}

The conservation of mass is a key property of fluid flow. In a closed fluid system
no mass is created at any point or destroyed. This fact is of great use later on in FVM were withing a subdivided discrete volume no material sources or sinks exists.
The physical changing value of the fluid's density $\rho$ is bound by this law in the overall system. The fluids mass only is transported by convective flux, which considering the above notations of a conservation law leads to:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:con_mass_1}
\frac {\partial}{\partial t} \int\limits_{\Omega} \rho d \Omega +
\oint\limits_{A} \rho \vec{v} \cdot d \vec{A} = 0
\end{equation}



\subsection{Conservation of Energy}

\subsection{Euler equations}
The Euler equations don't cover viscosity and any kind of heat conduction effects. They are of hyperbolic nature in space and time. Therefore these equations only cover \nameref{sec:invisicid_flow} of fluids.

\begin{equation}
\rho \frac{dv}{dt} = 
\rho ((\nabla \cdot v)\cdot v + \frac {\delta v}{\delta t }) =
f - \nabla p 
\end{equation}


\subsection{Navier-Stokes equations}
\label{sec:NSE_main}
The Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) are a set of equations to describe (in)compressible
viscous fluid flows. Therefore they can be seen as a extension and a more accurate version of the Euler equations that now include viscosity and heat conduction. Formulated by the French physicist Claude-Louis Navier with contributions from the Irish physicist George Stokes in the 19th century these set of equations are the cornerstones of today's understanding of fluid dynamics. The set of Navier-Stokes equations are in general parabolic equations in time and space.

\section{ The Concept of Discretization } \label{sec:Discretization}

The governing ordinary and partial differential equations that occur in many domains of physics describe
\emph{continuous} models. Solving those equations analytically would result in exact continuous solutions. However in practice
a exact analytical solution is not possible and needs to be replaced by a approximation that is found numerically with the aid of computers.
Modern digital computers are only capable of representing a finite and discrete amount of numbers with a finite amount of computational time, memory and storage.
Therefore any continuous model has to be transferred into a discrete model. This process is called \emph{discretization} and for a general spatial or temporal domain $ \Omega $ this is called \emph{domain discretization}. When this transfer happens several different kinds
of error are introduced into the approximate solution. Among others the most important ones are the \textbf{number representation error}, \textbf{roundoff error} and \textbf{truncation error}. For further reading on these error types please refer to \citep[pg.8]{Press2007}.

This section continues the numerical discussion of the CFD equations by focusing on the discretization process. The \emph{continuous} Navier-Stokes equations need to be 
discretized in order to solve them. Since this report focuses on unsteady fluids, the given equations are time-dependend. The differential equation in CFD always have a spatial component and in our case also have time dependent components in them. In the process of discretization these dimensions have to be discretized. This results in approaches for \textbf{spatial} discretization and \textbf{time} discretization. The spatial discretization can be roughly divided into Meshbased and Meshfree methods which are the focus of this report. A very brief outline into time discretization is given to better understand the proceedings of this report.  This Chapter concludes with the spatial discretization methods which are continued in the following Chapters. 


\subsection{Discretization in time}
The discretization of time in differential equations is necessary when time is present in the equations, and furthermore the physical value $ \kappa $ is changing over time.
A subdivision in space, can acquire information from neighbouring divisions in all directions. In contrast to this the discretization in time can only use previously
computed, known values from the past ($ \kappa_{t-1} , ... $) and the present computed value  $ \kappa_{t} $ to predict future values of it. How this is done is not the scope of this
report. Important to mention are two different types of methods: The \emph{explicit} methods and the \emph{implicit} methods. The explicit methods are easier to program
and involve only a small numerical effort per time step $ \delta t $. Unfortunately they are numerically not very stable and for most problems need very small time steps $ \delta t $. The implicit methods are much harder to program since they involve the solution of equation systems. This leads to a much higher numerical effort for one time step $ \delta t $. The benefit of implicit methods is that they are numerically stable and much larger time steps can be chosen. Which method is chosen for a CFD problem depends on the requirements of the solution and e.g. larger time steps are necessary. For further reading on this topic \citep[pg.63]{Laurien2009} provides a excellent introduction.


\subsection{Discretization in space}
The spatial discretization of a domain $ \Omega $ involves subdividing the continuous spatial distribution of a value (e.g. the distribution of temperature values on a heated iron plate) into finite entities. How this subdivision is done and how their properties like position are defined, depends first of all on what kind of
mathematical perspective one takes concerning the frame of reference. This can be either a Eulerian perspective or a Lagrangian perspective as described in \ref{sec:mathperspective}. These finite entities that replace this continuum in space can be furthermore bound by \nameref{sec:general_meshes} (Meshbased methods) or move freely in the form of particles (Meshfree methods). The main difference between meshbased and meshfree methods lie in the question if a overall geometrical description, aka a \textbf{mesh}, defines the domain discretization or not.
To explain this further please consider Figure \ref{fig:PerspVsDisMeth}. The Meshbased methods are coloured in red, the Meshfree methods in blue. In general the Meshbased methods, like the Finite Difference and Finite Volume method use a Eulerian perspective and consequently have a static frame of reference. The Finite Element methods are also Meshbased methods, but are a hybrid of the Eulerian perspective and the Lagrangian perspective. A mesh is present, but this mesh actually moves along with the properties in interest. The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method is a pure Lagrangian method with a dynamic frame of reference - the moving particles.

\section{Meshes}
\label{sec:general_meshes}
In CFD literature often the term \emph{grid} is also used to refer to a mesh. In this report we will stick to the commonly used term mesh. 

Structured and unstructured meshes




\subsection{Eulerian Mesh}
\label{subsec:eulerian_mesh}
The Eulerian Mesh incorporates the concept of the \nameref{sec:eulerian_descr} in its mesh description. Its reference system is fixed in space. Hence the mesh does not move
with the material which is simulated, on the contrary the material moves \emph{through} the Eulerian mesh. Depending on the discretization method the mesh is spatially divided into a certain finite amount of subdomains which are called for example \emph{nodes}, \emph{cells} or  \emph{volumes} (FVM). These subdomains remain fixed in space and there position, shape and volume usually does not chance over the time of the simulation. It is mainly used in strong correlation with the Finite Difference and Finite Volume Methods and its properties will be more discussed in the following Chapters. This mesh type is predominantly used in applications where the deformations of a material are not of great concern and the focus lies for example on the flow behaviour. It is yet important to understand that basically all solvable fluid dynamic problems can be discretized with a Eulerian Mesh, even the ones with strong deformations during simulation. This can be achieved with extremly fine meshes. As it will be shown in Chapter \ref{sec:problems_of_fdm} this imposes skyrocketing requirements on computation time and memory. Figure \ref{fig:EulerMesh} illustrates the concept of the Eulerian mesh.
The black, equidistant grid represents the Eulerian mesh, which stays fixed in space throughout a schematic deformation simulation of a material marked in blue. In reality
this coarse mesh would not have had the sufficient discretization to adequately capture even this simple deformation. At least a much finer discretization a the deforming edges would have been necessary. Comparing this simple example to the following Lagrangian Mesh already shows that Eulerian Meshes are not very useful for deforming solid mechanics. The analogy of deformations in solid mechanics are turbulent flows in CFD. Likewise a finer (local) discretization is needed to represent these fine grained physical effects.

\footnotetext{Illustration created in Autodesk Maya. This coarse mesh would not be sufficient enough to compute the detail of the deforming blue solid material.}


\subsection{Lagrangian Mesh}

The Lagrangian Mesh type is very similar to the Eulerian Mesh except that it incorporates the idea of the \nameref{sec:lagrangian_descr} into its spatial decomposition: A moving reference system. The mesh itself is clamped to the material and will deform and move accordingly as the material itself. Figure \ref{fig:LagMesh}
demonstrates such a deformation, in which a stretch behaviour is simulated. The mesh is \emph{body-fitted} to the actual geometry that deforms. In constrast to a Eulerian meshes we can cleary see how the triangular elements of the material deform from the left upper picture to the right lower picture during the simulation. This type of mesh is used in the Finite Element Method for CSM and CFD and has various
advantages over Eulerian Meshes, which will be discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:adv_of_fem}. However combining a mesh with the Lagrangian perspective also leads to problems
like \nameref{sec:remeshing_fem}. These problems can be overcome by discarding the concept of a mesh description for discretization and creating a meshfree and purer Lagrangian discretization concept with freely moving particles, which is done in Chapter \ref{Chapter 5}. For further reading please refer to \citep{Bennett2006}.
