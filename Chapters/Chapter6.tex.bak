\section{Mesh-free methods}
In this chapter the meshfree methods are introduced and explained on the example of the Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics method. For further reading \citep{Liu2003} is recommended.

\subsection{Why use mesh free methods?}

As described in Chapter 3 the scientific and engineering community have used mesh-based methods for
very long as they have cleary matured over the years. Still
Capability to work from
micro to macro scale applications.

The benefits of mesh-free methods versus classical mesh-based methods can be outlined as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mesh-free methods can easily handle strong deformations that would lead to
remeshing in a FEM simulation. This is due to the absence of a topological mesh which in course
of a deformation simulation would lead to problems in connectivity. ShafonLi 15
\item The mesh-free discretization with particals can provide a better representation of a varying
geometric shape.
\end{itemize}

In this report we will focus on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method as one of the earliest
and vastly used mesh-free methods.

\subsection{History of SPH}

The idea of SPH was at first formulated in the year 1977.Its origins do not lie in CFD but in the attempt to model and solve astrophysical problems in a new way. Initially Gingold and Monoghan \citep{Gingold1977} invented and named this approach at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge. Their primary intention was to find a approach that would be less computational intensive than FDM to solve various evolution processes (e.g. a star forming from interstellar matter). In their article they state how limited the use of FDM
is for their often asymmetrical/distorted problems, since in order to be be computed accurately they needed a excessive amount of grid points (resp. high spatial discretization). They proposed a new way of discretization that was based on a Lagrangian description and used a fixed amount of randomly distributed particles. To model physical scalar and vector fields and to retrieve those values during computation they used statistical methods (Monte Carlo integral determination) along with a \emph{kernel function}. Their approach will be described in more detail in the following sections.  
Inspired by the colleagues at Cambridge, Lucy \citep{Lucy1977} used this numerical approach to test succesfully the feasability of the fission hypothesis for protostars, which is a gas dynamical problem of rotating fluids in space. In contrast to CFD, these problems like the formation of galaxies or solar systems are of macroscopic scale.
Today SPH and its further developments are widely adapted in astronomy, CFD and even VFX. 


\subsection{Applications of SPH}
Because of several numerical advantages of SPH it is today not only used in astrophysics but also in a wide
range of simulations for fluid dynamics like underwater explosions (e.g. Liu et al. ) and even fluid creation
for visual effects in feature film (see Chapter 4...) One of this visual effects applications will be explained
in more detail with the SPH software "Realflow" and NAIAD. For further reading on the applications of CFD in computer graphics please refer to \citep{Bridson2008} and for new Hybrid Methods that have the advantages of Meshbased and Meshfree methods \citep[pg. 195]{Jackl2006} provides a simple introduction.

\subsection{Basic idea of SPH}
SPH is a so called meshfree particle method (MPM) and replaces the meshbased discretization with a initial distribution of particles over the problem domain. 

\section{Mathematical foundation}

\subsection{Kernel approximation}
in continuous form

\subsection{Particle approximation}
in discretized form

\subsection{Lagrangian Navier-Stokes equations}
Because SPH is a pure Lagrangian method, also the NSE need to be formulated in the Lagrangian form. In the previous Chapters mostly the Eulerian forms were used. 

\subsection{SPH vs. FEM}
While both methods in most implementatins share a Lagrangian perspective the main difference between the
FEM and particle based methods is indeed the absence of a overall grid in the SPH methods. While FEM is based
on infin? elements, they still exist withing a grid.

For further reading please refer to \citep{Li2004} and \citep{Liu2003}.

\subsection{Benefits of Meshfree methods over Meshbased methods}
The most problems of the Meshbased methods result not from the numerical capabilities of their methods, but from the simple presence of a mesh itself. 

- Better to model physical behaviour that has strong distortion
- Mesh dependend problems like remeshing are avoided
- No time-consuming (re-)generation of meshes for a problem
