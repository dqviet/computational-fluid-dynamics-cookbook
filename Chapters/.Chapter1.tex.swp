\section{The Field of Computational Fluid Dynamics}



"CFD (computational fluid dynamics) is a set of numerical methods applied to obtain
approximate solutions of problems of fluid dynamics and heat transfer."\citep[p.~215]{Zikanov2010}.

\subsection{Typical applications}

The demand for analyzing and/or predicting fluid flows is increasing in the fields of
engineering and science. Following inchoate list includes some evident industrial and science application examples and also some that might not come into mind when thinking about CFD. For further reading to each field some references are given.

\section{Focus of this Report}

This report gives a overview on the topic of CFD. But if will focus on the mesh-based and mesh-free methods and will in great detail describe latter. Furthermore it will pick out the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) as a representative of mesh-free methods and will compare it to the mesh-based Finite Elements Method (FEM).
Throughout the entire report a unsteady, time-dependend and evolving fluid is assumed.

Two questions should be answered:
1) What is the best way to sloshing

Since CFD is a huge topic the introduction and physical description chapters of this report will only explain the terms that are relevant to understand the last chapters.

\section{Content Outline and report structure}

This written report provides a comprehensive introduction and overview of computational fluid dynamics. While it focuses on the modern mesh-free SPH approach, the classical mesh based methods like FEM are also explained. Since the begin of this report should give a novice reader a basic understanding of CFD the first question that needed to be answered in order to structure this report was: \emph{What are the vital parts of CFD?} 
Considering the seminar was mostly directed at computer scientist who often need to understand a new subject in order to implement it, a more approach based question
could be easier to answer: \emph{What are the vital parts of CFD that a C.s undergrad needs to understand in order to implement a CFD system?}

To answer this question this report takes a look at the main steps dsaEpkRlV6VW5aaE1sWjZTVWhPZ of a general CFD problem solving approach.

The presented introduction from Chapter 2 through Chapter 3
Charles Hirsch 32text is organized in four chapters that are outlined as follows:

\section{Conventions}

Throughout this report the Harvard referencing style is used for quotes and general
literature references. 

\section{Further reading}
Along this report in each Chapter several references are given to a specific topic. For a comprehensive start with German literature \citep{Laurien2009} is a good choice.
